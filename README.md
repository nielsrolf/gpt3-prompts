# Prompts to make GPT-3 do cool stuff

In this repo, I want to collect cool prompts for GPT-3 such that the predefined prompt together with some new input get completed to something useful.

Ideas:
- Using GPT-3 for debugging
- Using GPT-3 to transform notes into scientific text
- ?

A better description  of the ideas and an evaluation can be found in the `README`s of the sub folders.
